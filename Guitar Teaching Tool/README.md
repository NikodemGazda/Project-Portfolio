# Guitar Teaching Tool
Learned JavaScript to create an app to make it easier to learn the guitar. I honestly use this very often and though the code is less complicated than the other projects listed in this portfolio, it's by far the most useful project and one of the ones I'm most proud of. Pure engineering--I had a problem and I solved it.

- For the code, see the [code](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Guitar%20Teaching%20Tool/guitar_sheet_code.js).
- For a copy of the tool, email me (nikigazda@gmail.com) with the subject "Request for Guitar Sheet Copy".
