# Project Portfolio
This repository is a collection of the individual and collaborative projects I've worked on during my undergraduate and graduate degrees at the University of Florida, as well as projects I've taken on personally to develop my skills and expand my expertise in computer engineering.

# List of Projects:
## **[The UkeMaster 3000:](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Projects/tree/main/The%20UkeMaster%203000)**
Ukulele robot that plays back any sounds recorded into it on a ukulele. Senior Design project for the Spring of 2023, won first place out of ~30 other projects. This design required extensive hardware programming using VHDL to create a complex system with custom SPI and Solenoid/Servo control modules as well as intricate, fine-tuned timing requirements.

**Relevant topics: FPGA, VHDL, Signal Processing, Troubleshooting**.

## **[GatorBreaker:](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Projects/tree/main/GatorBreaker)**

**Relevant topics: RTOS.**

## **[DRAM DMA Interface:](folder_work_in_progress)**
Half of the final for Recongifurable Computing, this project is a DRAM DMA interface that streams data to/from external DRAM. The main challenge of interfacing with the DRAMs is dealing with both control and data signals that cross clock domains. This project dealt with RTL Design, plenty of functional verification, time-domain crossing, and metastability.

## **[Guitar Teaching Tool:](folder_work_in_progress)**
Learned JavaScript to create an app to make it easier to learn the guitar. I honestly use this very often and though the code is less complicated than the other projects listed in this portfolio, it's by far the most useful project and one of the ones I'm most proud of. Pure engineering--I had a problem and I solved it.
