# List of Projects:
## **[The UkeMaster 3000:](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Projects/tree/main/The%20UkeMaster%203000)**
Ukulele robot that plays back any sounds recorded into it on a ukulele. Senior Design project for the Spring of 2023, won first place out of ~30 other projects. This design required extensive hardware programming using VHDL to create a complex system with custom SPI and Solenoid/Servo control modules as well as intricate, fine-tuned timing requirements.

## **[DRAM DMA Interface:](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/DRAM%20DMA%20Interface)**
Half of the final for Recongifurable Computing, this project is a DRAM DMA interface that streams data to/from external DRAM. The main challenge of interfacing with the DRAMs is dealing with both control and data signals that cross clock domains. This project dealt with RTL Design, plenty of functional verification, time-domain crossing, and metastability.

## **[RAID 5 File System from Scratch:](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/RAID%205%20File%20System)**
This final project for EEL4736 Principles of Computer System Design extends a client-server file system built in previous homework assignments to support multiple servers with redundant block storage, implementing RAID-5 for fault tolerance, data integrity, and performance optimization. The system handles corrupt blocks and server disconnections using checksum-based error detection and repair mechanisms, while ensuring load balancing, data parity management, and recovery processes.

## **[Linux Keyboard Driver:](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Linux%20Keyboard%20Driver)**
For the final project of EEL 5733 Advanced Systems Programming, I created a user space simulator that modeled the usbkbd driver, focusing on I/O communication concurrency and using pipes, threads, and URB completion handlers. The project demonstrated the correct handling of key events and LED statuses through multi-process and multi-threaded architecture.

This case study was a final project for EEL6763 Parallel Computer Architecture. In this case study, a partner (Jonathan Lijewski) and I were profiling and optimizing the LAGHOS high-order Euler equation solver. This included porting the code to HiPerGator, evaluating performance across MPI, MPI+OpenMP, and CUDA configurations, and refining the code.

## **[Guitar Teaching Tool:](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Project-Portfolio/tree/main/Guitar%20Teaching%20Tool)**
Learned JavaScript to create an app to make it easier to learn the guitar. I honestly use this very often and though the code is less complicated than the other projects listed in this portfolio, it's by far the most useful project and one of the ones I'm most proud of. Pure engineering--I had a problem and I solved it.
