# Undergraduate Project Portfolio
This repository is a collection of the personal and classroom projects I've completed during my undergraduate degree at the University of Florida.

# List of Projects:
## **[The UkeMaster 3000:](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Projects/tree/main/The%20UkeMaster%203000)**
Ukulele robot that plays back any sounds recorded into it on a ukulele. Senior Design project for the Spring of 2023, won first place out of ~30 other projects. This design required extensive hardware programming using VHDL to create a complex system with custom SPI and Solenoid/Servo control modules as well as intricate, fine-tuned timing requirements.

**Relevant topics: FPGA, signal processing, troubleshooting**.

## **[GatorBreaker:](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Projects/tree/main/GatorBreaker)**
Game of Breakout programmed from scratch using an RTOS on a TIVA C series LaunchPad. Final project for EEL4745C - MicroProcessor Applications 2, Fall of 2022. Project prompt was to create an interesting project with elements of a real-time operating system.

**Relevant topics: Machine learning, neural networks, transfer learning.**

## **[SRAM VLSI Design:](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Projects/tree/main/SRAM%20VLSI%20Design)**
Functioning transistor-scale design of an SRAM cell. This project was completed as a group for EEE4310 - VLSI Circuits and Technology. Project includes demux logic, 4x2 SRAM, sense amplifier, and read-write logic.

**Relevant topics: VLSI/IC Design, SRAM, digital circuit simulation and verification.**

## **[MIPS Architecture:](folder_work_in_progress)**
Functioning MIPS architecture capable of running programs built on the DE-10 Lite FPGA. This was a final project for EEL4712 - Digital Design. Project includes diagram to explain datapath and FSM.

**Relevant topics: VHDL, Digital Design, FPGA, Computer systems, FSM, Datapath**

## **[Guitar Teaching Tool:](folder_work_in_progress)**
Learned JavaScript to create an app to make it easier to learn the guitar. I honestly use this very often and though the code is less complicated than the other projects listed in this portfolio, it's by far the most useful project and one of the ones I'm most proud of. Pure engineering--I had a problem and I solved it.

**Relevant topics: Javascript, Music :)**

## **[FPGA Pong:](folder_work_in_progress)**
Fully functioning game of pong implemented using a Basys 3 FPGA in both VHDL and Verilog. Initially implemented as pure hardware, eventually evolved to full SoC with hardware, software, and OS. Group project in EEL5934 - System-on-Chip Design.
