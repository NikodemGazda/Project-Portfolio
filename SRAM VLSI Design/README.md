# SRAM VLSI Design
This project was a group final project for VLSI Circuits and Design in the Fall of 2022. The project features
a functional 4x2 SRAM cell with decoding, read-write, and sense amplifier logic. I was directly responsible for the
row/column decoder schematics and layouts, as well as the integration of all separate parts into one functioning SRAM cell.
The [final report](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Projects/blob/main/The%20UkeMaster%203000/UkeMaster%203000%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Projects/blob/main/SRAM%20VLSI%20Design/Report.pdf) 
in this repository gives a more detailed description of the project and each of its parts, and the
[Schematics and Layout](https://github.com/NikodemGazda/Projects/blob/main/SRAM%20VLSI%20Design/Schematics%20and%20Layouts.pdf)
provides more schematics and layouts to support the project.
