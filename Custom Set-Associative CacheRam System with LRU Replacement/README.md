# Custom Set-Associative CacheRam System with LRU Replacement
This is a custom hardware n-set cache and RAM system that uses the LRU replacement strategy, implemented and verified in SystemVerilog. This was a personal project (though it just so happened that I could use it as a Computer Architecture final project) where I aimed not only to have a better understanding of the internal workings of a Cache/RAM system and the LRU replacement strategy, but also so that I can familiarize myself more with SystemVerilog verification practices (CRV, assertions, reference models). The documentation totals ~30 pages/10k words, the design code is ~1k lines and the verification code is around ~3k lines. Best of all, it was completed all using [EDA playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/x/BhLN)! This link takes you to the top-level testbench. To see any other testbenches, you have to physcially copy and paste the code in, sorry.

Below is a short video summary I wrote to use for the final project.
