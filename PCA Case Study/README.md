# PCA Case Study
In this project (final project for EEL6763 Parallel Computing Architecture), a partner (Jonathan Lijewski) and I analyzed and optimized the LAGHOS high-order Euler equation solver by porting it to HiPerGator, evaluating its performance across MPI, MPI+OpenMP, and CUDA configurations, and refining the code based on profiling results.
