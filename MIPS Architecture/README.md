# MIPS Architecture

In this project, I designed, simulated, and implemented a 32-bit MIPS-like microprocessor in VHDL. The project involved creating core components such as the ALU, register file, and controller to execute provided test programs.

There were several deliverables testing the processorâ€™s functionality. I designed the ALU, memory, and datapath, then created a controller for memory-access and arithmetic instructions. I also demonstrated test cases, converted assembly code into MIFs, and validated the CPU on an FPGA board, earning extra credit with additional testbenches and MIF implementations.
